# What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?

"A Hash consists of key/value pairs. An Array consists only of values. The keys
in an array are integers starting from 0."

# 8.
# Create a Hash using both Ruby syntax styles.

hash_a = {:my_key => 'my value'}
hash_b = {my_other_key: 'my other value'}

# 9.
# Suppose you have a hash h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}

h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}

  # 1. Get the value of key `:b`.
  h[:b]

  # 2. Add to this hash the key:value pair `{e:5}`
  h[:e] = 5

  # 3. Remove all key:value pairs whose value is less than 3.5
  h.delete_if { |k,v| v < 3.5 }

# 10.
# Can hash values be arrays? Can you have an array of hashes? (give examples)

star_wars_quality = {good: [4, 5, 7], bad: [1, 2], okay: [3, 6] }

# Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best
# and why.

"Of the ones I've seen so far, my favorite is ruby-doc.org, because it is
thorough, easy to navigate, and does not contain extraneous information like
Rails methods which are of no current use to me."

# Given the following data structures. Write a program
# that moves the information from the array into the
# empty hash that applies to the correct person.

contact_data = [["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"],

# demonstrate how you would access Joe's email and Sally's phone number?

# In exercise 12, we manually set the contacts hash values one by one.
# Now, programmatically loop or iterate over the contacts hash from exercise 12,
# and populate the associated data from the contact_data array.
# Hint: you will probably need to iterate over ([:email, :address, :phone]),
# and some helpful methods might be the Array shift and first methods.

# Note that this exercise is only concerned with dealing with 1 entry
# in the contacts hash, like this:

  contact_data = ["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"]
  contacts = {"Joe Smith" => {}}

    hash_fields.each do |field|
      hash[field] = contact_data.shift
    end
  end


# As a bonus, see if you can figure out how to make it work
# with multiple entries in the contacts hash.

contact_data = [["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"],
            ["sally@email.com", "404 Not Found Dr.", "123-234-3454"]]

       'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

# and turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word.
